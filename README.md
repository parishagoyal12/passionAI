The EcoSort AI application is a great example of using technology to address a tangible, real-world problem. The project's core purpose is to simplify recycling by using artificial intelligence to classify waste materials. Here is a breakdown of how it works:


The Technology

The app's brain is a pre-trained machine learning model, likely a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a common type of deep learning model used for image classification. This model was trained on a large dataset of images of recyclable materials (like plastic bottles, paper, and glass) and non-recyclable items.
The front-end of the application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serves as the user interface. It allows a user to take or upload a photo of an item. JavaScript handles this input and sends the image data to the AI model. The model then processes the image and outputs a classification, such as "Recyclable" or "Compost." This process happens directly in the browser, which makes the app fast and efficient.

The Process

1. Image Upload: The user interacts with a simple interface to either take a new picture with their device's camera or select an image from their gallery.
2. AI Classification: The app's JavaScript code passes the image data to the machine learning model. The model analyzes the image's features—its shape, color, and texture—to determine the type of material.
3. Result Display: The model returns a classification, which the app then displays to the user, along with an explanation of whether the item can be recycled.
